    "This notebook is part of the project [Open Power System Data](http://open-power-system-data.org). Open Power System Data develops a platform for free and open data for electricity system modeling. We collect, check, process, document, and provide data that are publicly available but currently inconvenient to use. \n",

    "# 2. About Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub\n",
    "This file is a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). A Jupyter Notebook is a file that combines executable programming code with visualizations and comments in markdown format, allowing for an intuitive documentation of the code. We use Jupyter Notebooks for combined coding and documentation. We use Python 3 as programming language. All Notebooks are stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a platform for software development, and are publicly available. More information on our IT-concept can be found [here](http://open-power-system-data.org/it). See also our [step-by-step manual](http://open-power-system-data.org/step-by-step) how to use the dataplatform.\n",

    "# 3. About this Data Package\n",
    "We provide data in different chunks, or [datapackages](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/). The one you are looking at is on [national generation capacity](http://data.open-power-system-data.org/national_generation_capacity/), \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook processes data on aggregated generation capacity for European countries. The data includes generation capacities for nuclear, fossil and renewable fuels on an aggregated and, if possible, disaggregated technology levels. The majority of data reflects the years 2013 and 2014.\n",
    "The final output of the notebook is a list of national generation capacity differentiated by input fuels and technologies, as well as by different data sources."

    "The raw data is based on an extensive research of available national and international statistics. Due to the diverse structure of data sources, a compiled and structured dataset is used as input for further processing.

    "- **Energy source level 1** - Generation capacity by energy type (fossil, nuclear, renewable, other)\n",

    "- **Energy source level 3** - Generation capacity by fuel or energy source and detailed fuel for bioenergy\n",
    "- **Technology level** - Generation capacity by fuel and technology (e.g. combined cycle natural gas, gas turbine, onshore wind, offshore wind)\n",
